## Overview

This project introduces an **Explainable Vision Transformer (ViT)** pipeline combined with **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for efficient identification of drought stress in potato crops. The project aims to address the critical need for early detection of drought stress using **aerial imagery** and non-invasive imaging techniques. By capturing subtle phenotypic and physiological changes, the proposed method helps prevent crop loss before the drought impact becomes irreversible.

## Key Features

- **Vision Transformer (ViT)** extracts intricate spatial features from aerial images to identify subtle drought stress signatures.
- Two approaches:
  - **ViT + SVM:** ViT extracts features, and SVM classifies the crops as stressed or healthy.
  - **End-to-End ViT:** A dedicated classification layer within the ViT directly identifies drought stress.
- **Explainability:** Attention maps generated by the ViT highlight the specific spatial features associated with drought stress, enhancing the model's interpretability.

## Results

- Achieved high accuracy in drought stress identification.
- The attention maps provide insights into the plant features that ViT focuses on during classification.
  
## Applications

This model offers a robust and interpretable solution for drought stress monitoring, helping farmers make informed decisions for improved crop management.
